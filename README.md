## Task Details
### User Story: 
As a Teacher I want to be able to see which students are in my class each day of the week so that I can be suitably prepared.
### Notes:
You can use any technology that you think is suitable for this task.
The brief has been kept deliberately vague to allow you scope to apply your own assumptions and interpretations and to demonstrate your skills.
 
### MiroBoard
Good,Bad and the Ugly, here I have posted my process for completed the userStory. What needs to be improved and future workings
